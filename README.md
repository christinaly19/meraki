<h1> What is Meraki? </h1>
<p> 'Meraki' is a greek word that means to do something with passion, from the heart, with absolute devotion. It means to leave a part of yourself in the work you do. 
<br>
As the word suggets, Meraki helps writers accomplish this effect by interweaving self-reflection prompts with creative writing prompts, and encourages writers to be more productive with timed prompts.
